**Delilah Rest√≥**(Backend)

Backend for an online ordering system for a restaurant putting into operation the necessary parts to set up a REST API that allows CRUD operations on a data structure

Starting üöÄ These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Follow the instructions below to know how to deploy the project. Prerequisites üìã Install and configure the following programs which will be necessary for the correct operation of the application

Having a Text Editor, I recommend the use of VsCode.
Install and configure a MYSQL database engine.
Install NodeJS on your Operating System.
Install Postman which is a tool that will help us to make test queries to our API. Installation üîß Below you will find a series of steps that tell you what you must execute to have a local development environment running This step is totally optional as it provides you with a small test database
From your database monitor, run the database.sql file located inside the Back-End folder. Now, once the project is open from your text editor, open the VsCode terminal, make sure you are in the path of the Back-End folder and execute the following command line, with which all the necessary dependencies will be installed npm install Already installed all the dependencies for this project; we are going to create a file inside the same Back-End folder called ".env" where we are going to place the following information


**USER** = here put your database user

**PASS**= here enter your database password

**NAME_DB**= delilah_resto

**HOST** = localhost

**JWT_SECRET**= here put a secret word

From the terminal, execute the following command line npm start

delilahresto@1.0.0 start C:\Users\diazk\Documents\Projects\DelilahResto\DelilahResto\Back-End node index.js

Running the tests ‚öôÔ∏è To learn more about running tests, you could refer to the file spec.yaml. You can also find a file called DelilahResto.postman_collection.json located inside the Postman folder, which you can import into your Postman in order to facilitate testing of the different EndPoints of our API
